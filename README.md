# Data Structure Visualization App

Welcome to the **Data Structure Visualization App**! This project provides interactive visualizations of various data structures and algorithms to help users understand their inner workings. Currently, the app includes a visualization for **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, with plans to expand to other algorithms and data structures.

## Features
- 🎨 **Visual Representation**: See how algorithms traverse and manipulate data structures.
- 🎯 **Depth-First Search (DFS) Visualization**: Explore how DFS operates on graphs step by step.
- 📈 **Intuitive Interface**: Designed for ease of understanding with real-time animations.
- 🏗️ **Modular Architecture**: Easily extendable to add more algorithms in the future.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React (or another framework of choice for visualization)
- **Backend**: Node.js / Express (if needed)
- **Algorithms**: JavaScript / TypeScript implementation of data structures and algorithms
- **Canvas/SVG**: For rendering visual elements

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/andrew786e/Data-Structure-App.git
   cd data-structure-visualizer
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
4. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the visualization.

## Implemented Algorithms
- [x] **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- [ ] Breadth-First Search (BFS) *(Coming soon!)*
- [ ] Dijkstra’s Algorithm *(Planned)*
- [ ] Binary Search Tree Operations *(Planned)*
- [ ] Sorting Algorithms *(Planned)*

## Contributing
We welcome contributions! If you’d like to improve the project:
- Fork the repository.
- Create a new branch for your feature (`git checkout -b feature-name`).
- Commit your changes (`git commit -m "Added new feature"`).
- Push to your branch and open a Pull Request.

## Future Plans
- Improve UI for better visualization.
